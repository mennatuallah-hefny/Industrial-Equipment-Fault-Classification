# Industrial Equipment Fault Classification

## Project Description
This project involves detecting and classifying faults in industrial equipment using images. The goal is to develop a model capable of identifying faults from industrial equipment images and categorizing them correctly into different fault classes. The dataset used for this project is the **Fault Detection Dataset** from Kaggle.

### Task Breakdown
- **ResNet Architecture**: Implement ResNet architecture from scratch.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Apply Xception and DenseNet as pre-trained models using transfer learning on the dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluate the performance of the three models using the following metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix Visualization
  - Recall
  - Precision
  - F-Score
  - ROC Curve
  - AUC Score

## Requirements
### Models:
1. **ResNet**: Implement ResNet from scratch (using appropriate layers, skip connections, etc.).
2. **Xception**: Utilize Xception as a pre-trained model, applying transfer learning.
3. **DenseNet**: Use DenseNet as a pre-trained model, applying transfer learning.

### Evaluation:
For each of the three models, the following metrics will be computed:
- **Accuracy**: Measure of overall correctness of the model.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualization of model's classification results.
- **Recall**: Sensitivity, or true positive rate.
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
- **F-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC Curve**: Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
- **AUC Score**: Area Under the ROC Curve.

## Documentation
### 1. **Architectures Explanation**:
Each architecture will be explained in detail, including its key concepts, steps, and how it is implemented:
- **ResNet**: Discuss the concept of residual learning, skip connections, and how ResNet improves performance.
- **Xception**: Explain the depthwise separable convolutions in Xception and how they contribute to model efficiency.
- **DenseNet**: Illustrate how DenseNet connects each layer to every other layer in a dense block and its advantages for feature reuse.

### 2. **Graphs and Visualizations**:
The documentation will include:
- Performance comparison graphs for all three models.
- Visualizations of the confusion matrix and ROC curve for each model.

### 3. **Model Comparison**:
We will compare the three models based on the following:
- **Results Comparison**: Evaluate the models on accuracy, recall, precision, F-score, AUC, and other relevant metrics.
- **Pros and Cons**: Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each architecture and why one may be more suitable than the others for the specific task and dataset.
- **Preference for Architecture**: Explain which model works best in relation to the industrial equipment fault classification problem and why.

### 4. **References**:
Include a list of references that explain the architectures and techniques used in the project, including the original papers that introduced ResNet, Xception, and DenseNet.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Source**: Fault Detection Dataset on Kaggle.
- **Dataset Link**: [Industrial Tools Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharikaamritkar/industrial-tools-classification))

## Additional Notes:
Explore anomaly detection methods to improve fault identification for industrial equipment. This could involve training the models to identify anomalies in the images, which may indicate a fault in the equipment.

## Conclusion:
This project involves implementing and comparing three deep learning architectures—ResNet, Xception, and DenseNet—for the task of fault classification in industrial equipment. Through evaluation of the models using several metrics, we aim to find the best-performing model for the given dataset.
